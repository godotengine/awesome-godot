**Pull requests are welcome**, but keep this in mind:

- Projects must have a [free/libre](https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) license. If they lack a license, get to the original maintainer and ask them to add a license.
- The scripts, add-ons or plugins must be useful in a project.
- Follow the existing style.
- Sort in alphabetical order.
- Categorize by newest compatible Godot version.
- Projects related to cryptocurrency or NFT integrations are not allowed, for reasons including (but not limited to) the risk of scams.

If you don't know how to use pull requests, you can also create an issue.
