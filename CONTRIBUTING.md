# Contributing to the list

**Pull requests are welcome**, but keep this in mind:

- Projects must have a [free/libre](https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) license. If they lack a license, get to the original maintainer and ask them to add a license.
- The scripts, add-ons or plugins must be useful in a project.
- Follow the existing style. At the end of the description, mention the compatible Godot version as follows: `Project Name - Some example project (Godot 3.2).`
- Sort in alphabetical order.

If you don't know how to use pull requests, you can also create an issue.
